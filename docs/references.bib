   abstract = {The Netherlands is a frontrunner in the EU regarding the circular economy. On a national scale, there are higher targets than the EU for different packaging materials as plastics, glass, pa-per/cartons, and aluminium. For glass, the government advocates a recycling rate of more than 90%. In 2017, the rate realised was 86%. To reach this 4% higher goal, the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate wants to improve the collection infrastructure by increasing the number of bottle banks, with 800 by 2021. However, in the literature, an effectiveness analysis is lacking. Based on empirical evidence with data from 2007–2019, we show that increasing the number of bottle banks is not effective. Implementing a unit-based pricing system as a priced bag or container for unsorted waste can be more effective in achieving this goal, although this can have serious drawbacks.},

   abstract = {This study investigates the recycling behavior of Croatian citizens and identifies the determinants of individual recycling intention. It also addresses whether the existing deposit refund system for glass bottles in Croatia can be replaced by an expanded system that includes the return and reuse of almost all types of glass containers. A total of 427 Croatian citizens participated in the survey. Quantitative data analysis was performed using Structural Equation Modeling. In addition to the survey, a focus group was conducted with the relevant experts. The results confirmed the assumption about the pro-environmental orientation in Croatia. Citizens have a positive attitude towards the expanded deposit refund system in waste glass disposal and intend to implement it. The most significant predictor of their intention is their attitude towards the expanded deposit refund system, followed by familiarity with recycling. A person’s recycling intention is mainly determined by familiarity with recycling and perceived behavioral control. In the qualitative study, Croatian experts were generally positive about an expanded deposit refund system for glass containers but warned that implementation would not be without certain obstacles. The added value of the study is the creation of new knowledge for the design of local and national policies that can promote individuals’ environmentally friendly behavior and improve the glass waste disposal system in Croatia.},
